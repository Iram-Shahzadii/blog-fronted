              Welcome to <span className="text-blue-600 font-semibold ">Iram Blog</span>,
              a project I built while exploring the MERN stack and modern web development.
              This platform reflects my passion for coding, problem-solving, and sharing
              knowledge with others. Through these blogs, I aim to highlight technology,
              learning experiences, and ideas that inspire growth for both beginners and
              professionals. Every section of this site is a step in my journey as a
              developerâ€”and I hope it inspires you to keep building and learning too!
